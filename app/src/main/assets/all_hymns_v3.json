The details of his life and of his work as a reformer are accessible to English readers in a great variety of forms. Luther had a huge influence on German hymnody.\n\nLuther wrote this text sometime between 1527 and 1529 as a paraphrase of Psalm 46, though stanza four comes directly from Luther\u2019s own persecution experience. The most commonly used English version is a translation by Frederick H. Hedge in 1853. The text is full of battle imagery; this, coupled with the historic use of the hymn in actual battles, can be troubling for Christians who struggle with making sense of warfare. There is a case for arguing that we need to see this hymn in light of the history in which it was written, when Christians were fighting to defend their faith. However, this text also needs to be understood in terms of a spiritual struggle against the powers of darkness. Whether we believe in very real, physical demons and tempters, or less concrete forces, we are in the midst of a very real war between good and evil. That sounds very dramatic and almost clich\u00e9, but it is important to remember. Luther reminds us that we can\u2019t simply sit back and watch as horrible things unfold in our world, but that we must join the battle, knowing that God is on our side, and that we fight for a side that has, in a sense, already won."}, "topic": 1}, {"title": "How excellent", "num": 22, "verses": ["How excellent, how excellent,\nIs thy loving kindness.\nIs thy loving kindness O God,} {2x}\n\nTherefore the children of men. {2x}\nPut their trust, \nPut their trust \nUnder the shadow of thy wings. \n{2x paragraph}\n\nThey shall be abundantly satisfied. {3x}\nWith the fullness of thine house\nAnd thou shall make them drink of the rivers of thy pleasure.  {2x} \n{2x paragraph}\n\nHow excellent, how excellent,\nIs thy loving kindness.\nIs thy loving kindness O God,\nHow excellent, how excellent,\nIs thy loving kindness O God."], "chorus": null, "id": "hymn_22", "attribution": {"credits": null, "music_by": null, "lyrics_by": null}, "topic": 1}, {"title": "O how I love Jesus", "num": 23, "verses": ["There is a name I love to hear,\nI love to sing its worth;\nIt sounds like music in my ear,\nThe sweetest name on earth.", "It tells me of a Savior's love,\nWho died to set me free;\nIt tells me of His precious blood,\nThe sinner's perfect plea.", "It tells me what my Father hath\nIn store for every day,\nAnd though I tread a darksome path,\nYields sunshine all the way.", "It tells of One whose loving heart\nCan feel my deepest woe;\nWho in each sorrow bears\nA part that none can bear below."], "chorus": "O how I love Jesus,\nO how I love Jesus,\nO how I love Jesus,\nBecause He first loved me!", "id": "hymn_23", "attribution": {"credits": null, "music_by": "19th Century American melody .", "lyrics_by": "Frederick Whitfield, 1855.
