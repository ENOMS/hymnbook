<ol>
    <li>
        <span>To God be the glory, great things He has done;</span>
        <span>So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,</span>
        <span>Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,</span>
        <span>And opened the life gate that all may go in.</span>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="chorus">
    <span>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</span>
    <span>Let the earth hear His voice!</span>
    <span>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</span>
    <span>Let the people rejoice!</span>
    <span>O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,</span>
    <span>And give Him the glory, great things He has done.</span>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <span>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,</span>
        <span>To every believer the promise of God;</span>
        <span>The vilest offender who truly believes,</span>
        <span>That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.</span>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span>Great things He has taught us, great things He has done,</span>
        <span>And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;</span>
        <span>But purer, and higher, and greater will be</span>
        <span>Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.</span>
    </li>
