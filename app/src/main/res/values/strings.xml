       <li>
        <span>To God be the glory, great things He has done;</span>
        <span>So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,</span>
        <span>Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,</span>
        <span>And opened the life gate that all may go in.</span>

       <p class="chorus">
           <span>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</span>
            <span>Let the earth hear His voice!</span>
            <span>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,</span>
            <span>Let the people rejoice!</span>
            <span>O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,</span>
            <span>And give Him the glory, great things He has done.</span>
       </p>
       <li>
           <span>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,</span>
            <span>To every believer the promise of God;</span>
            <span>The vilest offender who truly believes,</span>
            <span>That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.</span>
       </li>

       <li>
           <span>Great things He has taught us, great things He has done,</span>
            <span>And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;</span>
            <span>But purer, and higher, and greater will be</span>
            <span>Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.</span>
